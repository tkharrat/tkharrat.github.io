# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a trained mathematician trying to educate computers to understand data. I started interrogating data seriously in 2010 when I was trying to build automated trading strategy to beat the US equity market. In 2012, I read my first paper about football analytics and since then I am dedicating most of working hours to this field. I am mostly interested in problems where accurate predictions are required (the outcome of a football game, the final position of the team in a league, ...) and if possible where a strong benchmark is available. After few years in Academia (mainly as a research fellow) and various working experiences (big corporations as well as early stage start-ups), I decided recently to work full-time on an [ambitious project](https://realanalytics.org/) I started with another academic colleague. Our mission is to make cutting edge research in the field available to decision-makers in football for better recruitment.'
